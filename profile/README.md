# Vectorfy Co

**AI Consultancy & Engineering | Melbourne, Australia**

We help organisations implement production-grade AI solutions that actually work. Not just proof-of-concepts—real systems that scale.

## What We Do

Vectorfy bridges the gap between AI experimentation and production deployment. We architect, build, and deploy AI systems that integrate seamlessly with your existing infrastructure.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **AI Solution Architecture** – Design systems that leverage LLMs, vector databases, and modern AI frameworks without the fragility
- **Production AI Engineering** – Build robust pipelines for transcription, analysis, classification, and generation at scale
- **Cloud-Native Infrastructure** – Azure, Kubernetes, microservices architectures built for AI workloads
- **Full-Stack Development** – End-to-end applications with Python, TypeScript, React, and Next.js
- **DevOps & Observability** – CI/CD, monitoring, and instrumentation for AI systems in production

## Our Approach

**1. Engineering-First**  
We're not prompt engineers—we're systems engineers who understand LLMs. Our solutions handle failures gracefully, scale efficiently, and integrate with your existing tech stack.

**2. Production-Ready from Day One**  
No prototypes that need "productionization." We build with security, observability, and reliability baked in from the start.

**3. Technology Agnostic**  
We work with whatever makes sense for your use case: OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models, or hybrid approaches. The goal is solving your problem, not selling a specific stack.

## Tech Stack

**AI & ML**
- Large Language Models (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, open-source)
- PydanticAI, LangChain, custom frameworks
- Vector databases and semantic search
- Audio transcription and NLP pipelines

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- Azure (AKS, Functions, DevOps, Key Vault)
- Kubernetes with Istio service mesh
- Docker, CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code
- OpenTelemetry, monitoring, and observability

**Development**
- Python (FastAPI, async patterns, data processing)
- TypeScript, React, Next.js
- PostgreSQL, Redis, GeL/EdgeDB
- Microservices architecture

## Featured Work

### Call Analysis Platform
Built a comprehensive AI-powered call transcription and quality assurance system processing thousands of customer interactions. Kubernetes-based microservices with real-time transcription, sentiment analysis, and automated QA scoring.

**Stack:** Azure Kubernetes Service, Python microservices, PureCloud integration, React frontend, OpenTelemetry observability

### Enterprise AI Integrations
Developed Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enabling LLMs to interact with enterprise systems—databases, APIs, and internal tools—with proper authentication and rate limiting.

**Stack:** Python FastMCP, TypeScript MCP SDK, RESTful APIs, OAuth integrations

---

## Open Source

We believe in contributing back to the community. You'll find tools, libraries, and examples of production AI patterns across our repositories.

- **MCP Servers** – Model Context Protocol implementations for common enterprise systems
- **AI Observability Tools** – OpenTelemetry integrations for LLM applications
- **Infrastructure Templates** – Kubernetes and Azure DevOps configurations for AI workloads
- **Development Guides** – LLM-optimized documentation and best practices

---

## Working With Us

**Best For:**
- Organisations moving from AI experimentation to production
- Teams needing enterprise-grade AI infrastructure
- Companies requiring full-stack AI solution development
- Projects where reliability and scale matter from day one

**Not a Fit If:**
- You need basic chatbot implementations (there are simpler options)
- You're looking for research or academic ML work
- You want a team that only does front-end or only does infrastructure
